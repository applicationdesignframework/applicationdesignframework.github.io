# High-level application design from use case to code
**Note:** It is not necessarily the actual Amazon EC2 design.

## Use case
Offer virtual machines (instances) as a service.

### Business flow
![](https://github.com/alexpulver/adf/assets/4362270/e39e7d4c-aea3-4130-b1b8-60da4187745c)

## Features and stories
Instance type with Intel CPU and local NVMe storage
* As a developer, I want to launch an instance
* As a developer, I want to stop an instance
* As a developer, I want to delete an instance
* As a budget owner, I want to know the usage cost of an instance
* As a security engineer, I want to define instanceâ€™s network perimeter

## Requirements
Requirements are not described in this example for brevity.

## Architecture

### Technical flow

### Application boundaries
**Context**

We need to define application boundaires based on the technical flow.

**Decision**

The decision is to create two applications: _EC2 Instances Console_ and _EC2 Instances Control Plane_. 

**Consequences**

### EC2 Instances Console components

**Context**

We need to define EC2 Instances Console components based on the technical flow.

**Decision**

_EC2 Instances Console_ application contains _Toolchain_ and _Service_ components. _Toolchain_ component contains _Deployment Pipeline_ and _Pull Request Build_ components. _Service_ component contains _Network_, _Ingress_, _UI_, _Database_ and _Monitoring_ components. _Toolchain_ and _Service_ resources deploy as a stack each.

**Consequences**

### EC2 Instances Console technologies

**Context**

We need to choose technologies to implement EC2 Instances Console components.

**Decision**

**Consequences**


### EC2 Instances Control Plane components

**Context**

We need to define EC2 Instances Control Plane components based on the technical flow.

**Decision**

_EC2 Instances Control Plane_ is not described in this example for brevity.

**Consequences**

## Code

### Git repositories
EC2 Instances Console: `ec2-instances-console`

### Project structure

**EC2 Instances Console**

The example uses AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) pseudo code for resources configuration. It should be possible to use the same approach with other tools.
